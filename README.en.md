Space Station 14 is an RPG inspired by the cult classic Space Station 13. Space Station 14 is filled with fun and chaos. At first glance, the game seems complex, and it is, but we will help you get used to this game and find your place. The game runs on its own [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox) engine, written in C#.

## Documentation

The official [documentation site](https://docs.spacestation14.io/) has all the information you need about SS14 content, engine, game design and much more. There are also many useful materials for beginner developers.
